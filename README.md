# BOTS
# WhatsApp Chatbot Integration

This project implements a chatbot using Flask, Twilio API for WhatsApp, and OpenAI API. The chatbot is designed to handle incoming WhatsApp messages, providing dynamic and context-aware responses generated by OpenAI.

## Features

- **Flask Web Application**: The core of the project is a Flask web application that serves as the backend for handling incoming WhatsApp messages.

- **Twilio API Integration**: Utilizes the Twilio API to connect with WhatsApp, allowing users to interact with the chatbot through their WhatsApp accounts.

- **OpenAI API Integration**: Integrates with the OpenAI API to generate meaningful and context-aware responses based on user queries.

## How It Works

1. **Twilio Integration**: The Flask app is connected to Twilio for receiving incoming WhatsApp messages.

2. **OpenAI Processing**: User queries are processed by OpenAI to generate responses that are sent back to the user.

3. **Dynamic Responses**: The chatbot provides dynamic responses, including generating images or answering questions, depending on user input.

## Setup

1. **Clone Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Configure APIs**: Set up your Twilio and OpenAI API keys in the appropriate configuration files.

4. **Run Flask App**: Start the Flask app locally:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

5. **Expose Locally**: Use Ngrok or a similar tool to expose your local server to the internet:

    ```bash
    ngrok http 5000
    ```

6. **Configure Webhook URL**: Update the Twilio Sandbox configuration with the Ngrok public URL.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main Flask application handling incoming WhatsApp messages.
- `ngrok_setup.py`: Ngrok configuration and setup for exposing the local server.
- `openai_integration.py`: Functions for interacting with the OpenAI API.
